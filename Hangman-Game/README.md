# Hangman Game


A simple **Hangman word game** developed for iOS using Swift 5. The app is intuitive and allows users to guess words, each time a word is answered incorrectly points are deducted and the Hangman is drawn on the screen. 

The Hangman game uses the MVC design pattern and loads a list of words from the app bundle. The design and sound effects are influenced by arcade classics. 

The app is actively upgraded to adopt the latest features of iOS and Swift language.
